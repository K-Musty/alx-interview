### Concepts Needed:

    Prime Numbers:
        Understanding what prime numbers are.
        Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

    Sieve of Eratosthenes:
        An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

    Game Theory:
        Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
        Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

    Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
        Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

    Python Programming:
        Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
        Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.

###Tasks
0. Prime Game
mandatory

Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

    Prototype: def isWinner(x, nums)
    where x is the number of rounds and nums is an array of n
    Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
    If the winner cannot be determined, return None
    You can assume n and x will not be larger than 10000
    You cannot import any packages in this task

- Example:

    x = 3, nums = [4, 5, 1]

First round: 4

    Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3
    Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1
    Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose

Second round: 5

    Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3, 5
    Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1, 5
    Maria picks 5 and removes 5, leaving 1
    Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose

Third round: 1

    Ben wins because there are no prime numbers for Maria to choose

Result: Ben has the most wins
